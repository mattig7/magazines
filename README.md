# magazines
This is a simple Python program to find and download all magazines from given URLs (with 'magname' parameter for the folder they get downloaded to. 

Uses an JSON file to define URL to search. If this file is not present (not by default) then it has default magazine URLs (hackspace and magpi) to download from. The JSON file will be created on first run

Note that python3 is required for this program! Come on people! Upgrade with the times!
